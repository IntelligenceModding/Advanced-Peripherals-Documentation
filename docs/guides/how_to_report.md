### How to report an issue or request a feature


We appreciate your dedication to making the project better by helping us squash those pesky bugs and suggesting exciting new features. Reporting a bug or requesting a new feature is easy and friendly. Here's how to do it:


## Reporting a Bug

**Expected Behavior:** Start by describing what you expected to happen when you encountered the bug. This helps us understand the issue better.

**Steps to Reproduce:** Provide a clear, step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the bug. Include every detail, like which items you used, where you were, and what actions you took.

**Logs:** If the bug is critical, or you're not sure what's causing it, including logs can be a game-changer. Share any error messages or log files related to the issue.

**Pictures:** A picture is worth a thousand words! If you can, add screenshots to visually demonstrate the problem.

**Optional - Video:** Want to be an awesome bug hunter? Record a short video showing the bug in action. It can make the bug-hunting process even smoother!

## Requesting a Feature

**Clear Description:** Tell us exactly what you want to see in the mod. Be specific and clear about the new feature's purpose.

**API Functions:** If your feature request involves changes or additions to the Lua functions, let us know which functions or methods you'd like to see added or modified.

**Use Cases:** Explain how this new feature would enhance your gameplay. Share scenarios where it would come in handy.
