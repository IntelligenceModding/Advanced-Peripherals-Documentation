    ![!Image of the AR Goggles item](/../assets/images/previews/ar_goggles.png){ align=right }

The AR Goggles can be used in combination with the AR Controller to have a customizable overlay wherever you go. Fun!  
See the documenation for the [AR Controller](../peripherals/ar_controller.md) to learn more.

!!! hint
    To link your goggles to an AR Controller, right click it with them in your hand. Multiple Goggles can be linked to one Controller.

!!! bug
    The AR Goggles are slightly buggy in 1.18x and completely disabled in 1.19x. We work on a rework of the AR Goggles system with a bunch of new features for 0.8/1.0
